<h3> Payment: </h3>
  <p> Payments will only be accepted through PayPal in USD. I require full payment before starting a commission. Once I accept your commission, I will send an invoice via PayPal, due in 10 days. Once the invoice is paid, I will start your commission. If the invoice is not paid, I will have to cancel the commission. 

 </p>	  
<h3> Deadlines: </h3>
  <p> Depending on my workload, the turnaround time should take no longer than 2 weeks. I will provide an estimate time for completion, and/or indicate if there is a delay in completing your commission. You may request a WIP (with a watermark included) at any time.
  
  </p>
<h3> Usage Policy: </h3> 
  <p> My artwork is for personal use only. No commercial use of my artwork is allowed. You may use your commissioned artwork for personal use, but cannot claim that you are the one who made it (this includes, but is not limited to, cropping the art to use for icons, banners, badges, tattoos, etc..) I reserve the right to my artwork and the right to post it; if you would like your commission to be private, please let me know!
 
  </p>
<h3> Refunds: </h3> 
 <p> You may receive a full refund only if I have not started your commission. If I have started your commission, I will issue a partial refund based on how much work is done. If I cannot finish your commission for whatever reason, you will be refunded in full. No refunds will be issued once artwork has been completed.
